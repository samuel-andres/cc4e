/* Exercise RS-8
 * Write a C program to play a guessing game with
 * the user that is equivalent to the Python program below.
 * Your program should use a while loop and multi-way branch
 * if (i.e. use else if).
 * while True:
    try:
        line = input()
    except:  # If we get EOF
        break
    line = line.strip()
    guess = int(line)
    if guess == 42:
        print('Nice work!')
        break
    elif guess < 42 :
        print('Too low - guess again')
    else :
        print('Too high - guess again')
 *
